Theoratical frameworks and applied approaches for analysis and synthesis of robust and
adaptive control systems of nonlinear oscillations are presented. The possible high dimension
and complex nonlinearity of mathematical models of oscillating plants are taken into 
stability for analisys and synthesis of nonlinear control systems of oscillations. The book 
contains some original results like intagral input-to state stability with respect to set;
development of Control Lyapunov functions approach for problem of stabilization with respect to the 
output; development of backstepping and analytical construction of aggregated controllers methods 
for problem of robust stabilization of a set; adaptive stabilization of a set via speed gradient 
approach; adaptive tuning to bifurcation problem statement and solution; dynamical adaptive
synchronization approach. Applicability of obtained solutions are demonstrated basing on computer
simulation of different pendulum systems.

The book will be useful for researchers, engineers, university lecturer and postgraduate
students specializing in the fields of applied mathematics and engineering, such as automatic
control, mechanics and robotics.
