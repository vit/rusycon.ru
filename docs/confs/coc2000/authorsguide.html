Camera-Ready Manuscript Submission</h2>

<hr SIZE="5">
<ul>Authors of accepted papers should submit <b>two camera-ready copies</b>
of their manuscripts to the Organizing Committee along with the required
forms <b>(<a href="copyright.html">The IEEE Copyright form</a>, <a href="regist.htm">The
COC 2000 Registration form</a></b>.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Two copies</font></b> of the paper must be
sent by post, not fax, to the address given below. Your manuscript must
be received by <b><font color="#FF0000">April 15, 2000</font></b>.
<br>The address is:
<ul>
<ul><b>Prof. A.L. Fradkov</b>

<br><b>61 Bolshoy V.O.</b>
<br><b>St.Petersburg 199178, Russia</b></ul>
</ul>

<hr>International participants should take into account that the state
post service is very slow in Russia (e.g., it takes about 3 weeks to deliver
a letter from USA to St.Petersburg), so Express mailing services are recommended.</ul>

<h3>
Important information</h3>
<img SRC="purpball.gif" height=10 width=10>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size=+0>You
need to submit a camera-ready manuscript using a high quality (300 dpi
or more) laser printer on exact size A4 (210 mm by 297 mm) white paper,
using one side of a sheet.</font>
<br><img SRC="purpball.gif" height=10 width=10>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those
participants who will deliver a <b>Plenary or Semi-Plenary Lecture</b>
should submit a full-size paper of <b>six (6)</b> pages, <b>four (4)</b>
pages are allowed for each <b>Regular Paper</b> and each <b>Poster Paper</b>
is allotted <b>two (2)</b> pages in the Conference Proceedings. Each manuscript
must follow this rule. Authors with multiple submissions must apply these
guidelines to each manuscript separately. Up to three additional pages
will be permitted for a charge of 80 US Dollars for each additional page.
<br><img SRC="purpball.gif" height=10 width=10>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deadline
for receipt of your camera-ready manuscript by the Organizing Committee
is <font color="#FF0000">April 15, 2000</font>. Papers received after the
deadline, or without the necessary forms, may not be included in the proceedings.
<br><img SRC="purpball.gif" height=10 width=10>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be sure
to fill out, and send with your manuscript, the IEEE Copyright Form.
<br><img SRC="purpball.gif" height=10 width=10>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The title
and authorship of your paper will appear in the final program, in the table
of contents, and author index of the proceedings as they are shown in your
manuscript submitted to the Organizing Committee.
<br><img SRC="purpball.gif" height=10 width=10>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
mailing your manuscript to the Organizing Committee, make sure to include
your complete mailing address and type of your report (Plenary, Semi-Plenary,
Regular or Poster) on the outside of the envelope.
<h3>
Preparation of Exact Size Manuscripts</h3>
Your paper must be printed actual size (i.e., exactly how it is to appear
in the proceedings) in two columns. To ensure uniformity of appearance
for the proceedings, the papers should conform to the following specifications.
If your paper deviates significantly from these specifications, the printer
may not be able to include your paper in the proceedings. It is highly
recommended to use LaTeX in preparing and formatting your manuscript.
<p>The height of the text block should be <b>240 mm</b>. The width of each
column should be <b>80 mm</b>. The distance between the two columns of
text should be <b>5 mm</b>.
<br>Thus, the width of the text block is <b>165 mm</b>. The text should
be centered left-to-right on the page, i.e., left and right margins should
be the same. The distance
<br>from the bottom edge of the paper to the bottom of the last line of
type on the page should be not less than <b>30 mm</b>. This allows room
for the printer to insert the copyright notice on the first page and page
numbers.
<p>Please, do not unsert page numbers or other information into running
headers or footers. This will be done by us.
<p>The Conference <b>requires</b> a font size of <b>10 points</b> or greater.
Some technical formatting programs print mathematical formulas in italic
type, with subscripts and superscripts in a slightly smaller font size.
This is acceptable. For the main body of the text the 10 point size roman
font should be used.
<p>The title should be centered across the top of the first page. The <b>22
point </b>size bold font is recommended.
<p>The authors' names and addresses should be centered below the title.
The <b>14 point </b>size roman font is recommended. Please include your
e-mail address. For multiauthored papers names and addresses can be placed
either side by side, or one under another. Please do not put addresses
in footnotes.
<p>Do not indent the initial lines of paragraphs. Leave a line clear between
paragraphs.
<p>References should be numbered consecutively throughout the paper and
be listed at the end of the paper with the main heading <b>References</b>.
When citing references in the text, type the corresponding number in square
brackets, e.g [1]. References should be complete and in standard IEEE style.
<p>Equations have to be numbered consecutively with the number in parenthesis,
flush to the right.
<p>Only simple line drawings and graphs are allowed. Halftone illustrations
(pictures) and photographs are not acceptable. Do not supply Xerox copies.
For the best reproduction and handling of illustrations, we prefer that
they be included in your wordprocessor file or that the original be pasted.
Many wordprocessors allow the insertion of figures from a drawing program
or the insertion of a scanned image. For pasting of original illustrations
use glue such as a glue stick. Please do not use clear tape. Do not use
poor photostats, ozalids, blueprints, hectos, Xerox, etc., for the drawings,
illustrations, or charts, since shades of blue, green, and brown do not
photograph successfully. Figures should be inserted near their citation
or at the end of the manuscript, after References. Large figures may extend
over two columns if necessary. Make sure that you number and include a
caption for each figure.
<p>Footnotes should be avoided. Authors' addresses have to be placed after
the authors' names below the title of the paper. Information about any
financial support should be placed in the subsection <b>Acknowledgements</b>
at the end of your paper.
<h3>
Hints for LaTeX users</h3>
It is highly recommended that your manuscript is prepared using LaTeX document
preparation system. LaTeX users have to employ a style file <a href="coc2000.sty">coc2000.sty.</a>
For a sample tex file using this style see file <a href="for_auth.tex">for_auth.tex</a>.
<br>The style <a href="coc2000.sty">coc2000.sty</a> is a modified version
of cdcartA4.sty kindly permitted for use by its author Silvano Balemi.
Modification was made by Alexander Churilov. (However, all the questions
concerning the style have to be sent to the Organizing Committee).</ul>
