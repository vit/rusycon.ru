<H6>JOINT AUTHORSHIP</H6>

<H6>For jointly authored works, all the joint authors should sign, or one
of the authors should sign as an authorized agent for the others. In the

<HR>PART B -- U.S. GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE CERTIFICATION</H5>

<H6>Authors who are U.S. Government employees are not required to sign
Part A of the IEEE Copyright Form, but any coauthors outside the U.S. Government
are required to sign Part A (see JOINT AUTHORSHIP overleaf). Authors whose
work was performed under a U.S. Government contract or grant, but who are
not Government employees, are required to sign Part A of this form (see
item 4 under Part A).</H6>

<H6>This will certify that all authors of the above work are employees
of the U.S. Government and performed this work as part of their official

<HR>PART C -- CROWN COPYRIGHT</H5>

<H6>Authors who are employees of the British Government (or a British Commonwealth
Government) and whose works are subject to Crown Copyright may sign Part
C below. IEEE recognizes and will honor Crown Copyright as it does U.S.
Copyright. It is understood that, in asserting Crown Copyright, IEEE in
no way diminishes its rights as publisher. Sign only if ALL authors are
subject to Crown Copyright. Signing Part C will certify that all authors
of the above work are subject to Crown Copyright. (Appropriate documentation
and instructions regarding wording of Crown Copyright notice may be attached.)</H6>

<HR>Notes and Information for Authors and Their Employers</H5>

<H5>IEEE POLICY</H5>

<H6>In connection with its publishing activities, it is the formal policy
of the IEEE to own the copyrights to all copyrightable material in its
technical publications and to the individual contributions contained therein,
in order to protect the interests of the IEEE, its authors and their employers,
and, at the same time, to facilitate the appropriate re-use of this material
by others. The IEEE distributes its technical publications throughout the
world and does so by various means such as hard copy, microfiche, microfilm,
and electronic media. It also abstracts and may translate its publications,
and articles contained therein, for inclusion in various compendiums and
similar publications, etc. When an article is submitted for publication
to the IEEE, the IEEE understands that its acceptance of the article implies
that IEEE has the rights to do all of the things it normally does with
such an article.</H6>

<H6>IEEE Policy 6.17 -- CLEARANCE OF PAPERS -- applies to all material
submitted to IEEE: &quot;The IEEE must of necessity assume that material
presented at its meetings or submitted to its publications is properly
available for general dissemination to the audiences these activities are
organized to serve. It is the responsibility of the authors, not the IEEE,
to determine whether disclosure of their material requires the prior consent
of other parties and, if so, to obtain it.&quot;</H6>

<H6>Furthermore, the IEEE must assume, if an author uses within his/her
article previously published and/or copyrighted material, that permission
has been obtained for such use and that any required credit lines, copyright
notices, etc. are duly noted.</H6>

<H5>IEEE OBLIGATIONS</H5>

<H6>In exercising its rights under copyright, the IEEE will make all reasonable
efforts to act in the interests of the authors and employers as well as
in its own interest. In handling third party reprint/republication requests
for an IEEE work, the IEEE requires that 1) the consent of the first-named
author be sought as a condition in granting republication (of a full paper)
to others; and 2) the consent of the employer be obtained as a condition
in granting permission to others to re-use all or portions of a paper for
promotion or marketing purposes.</H6>

<H5>AUTHOR/COMPANY RIGHTS</H5>

<H6>If you are employed and you prepared your paper as a part of your job,
the rights to your work rest initially with your employer. In that case,
when you sign the copyright transfer form, we assume you are authorized
to do so by your employer and that your employer has consented to all the
terms and conditions of this form. If not, it should be signed by someone
so authorized. (See also Policy 6.17 above.)</H6>

<H6>SPECIAL NOTE TO EMPLOYERS: Just as the IEEE requires a signed copyright
transfer form (for copyrightable material) in order to do &quot;business
as usual,&quot; it is the intent of the transfer portion of the form to
return rights to the author and employer so that they, too, may do &quot;business
as usual.&quot; (See note at bottom of page re. further details.)</H6>

<H6>Please note that, although authors are permitted to reuse all or portions
of their IEEE-copyrighted material in other works, this does not include
granting third party requests for reprinting, republishing, or other types
of re-use. All third party requests must be handled by the IEEE Copyrights
Permissions Office. </H6>
