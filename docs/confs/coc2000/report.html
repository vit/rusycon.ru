<hr>
The 2nd International Conference "CONTROL OF OSCILLATIONS AND CHAOS" 
(COC 2000) took place in St.Petersburg, Russia, on July 5-7, 2000. 
It was organized by the Institute for Problems of Mechanical 
Engineering of Russian Academy of Sciences, St.Petersburg State 
University, and St.Petersburg Informatics and Control Society. 
It was co-sponsored by the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society, 
International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM), 
Russian Academy of Sciences and Russian Foundation for Basic Research
with technical co-sponsorship of the IEEE Control Systems Society and 
Russian IEEE Section.
<p>
Various problems related to analysis, synchronization and control of
complex oscillatory dynamical  systems, with emphasis on both theory
and applications were considered. The papers from different 
scientific fields (mathematics; physics; mechanics; chemistry; 
mechanical, electrical and civil engineering, biology, economics, 
etc.) have been presented. About 180 papers  have been selected by 
the International Program Committee from 210 submissions for 
inclusion into the final Program. More than 170 participants 
including 68 persons out of Russia have been registered; 7 plenary, 
9 semi-plenary, 96 regular and 40 poster papers have been presented.
Three volumes of conference Proceedings include 165 papers 
representing 33 countries. The largest number of papers have been 
presented from Russia (87), USA (14), Italy (8), Japan (6), 
Germany (6), Brasil (4), Korea (4), Argentina (3), P.R.China (3), 
France (3), Ukraine (3), Yugoslavia (3).
<p>
The Conference took place in the "Dom Uchenyh" ("House of 
Scientists") - beautiful palace in the historical center of 
St.Petersburg next to the Tsar's Winter Palace and the Hermitage 
museum. Social Program included sightseeing tours: survey bus tour 
of St.Petersburg, tours of the Hermitage and bus tour to Petergof. 
The conference banquet took place on Friday 7 July in the House of 
Scientists.
<p>
<center><b>SUMMARY OF THE SCIENTIFIC PROGRAM</b></center>
<p>
The Conference as a whole has demonstrated continuing interest in
analysis and control methods for irregular (chaotic) oscillations.
The papers from various scientific fields were presented at the 
Conference. Most papers were devoted to dynamics and control of 
systems from the two broad fields:
<ul><li>   mechanical systems (main applications are  motion control, 
robotics, vibrational technologies);</li> 
<li>electrical or electronic systems (main applications are in 
the field of telecommunications and power systems).</li></ul>
It  allowed to bring together and to cross-fertilize ideas from 
these fields which have many similarities. Such a possibility 
arised due to support of the Conference by both IEEE and IUTAM.
A number of the papers addressed the problems of analysis of 
complex behavior in physical systems. Significant attention was 
paid to analysis and design of neural networks, study of 
complexity and synchronization in nonlinear systems. Also the 
papers with applications to  chemical technologies, geophysics, 
medicine, economics, etc. have been presented.
<p>
Some of plenary/semiplenary papers contained important 
theoretical results:
<ul>
<li><b>Belotserkovsky O.M., Shevelev Yr.D., Maksimov F.A.</b> (Russia)<br>
      Some Problems of Turbulence and Instabilities</li>
<li>    <b>Blekhman I.I., Lurie K.A.</b> (Russia-USA) <br>

Modeling, Identification, and Design of Nonlinear Adaptive Systems"
was delivered by Prof. <b>R.J.P. De Figueiredo</b> (USA) at the closing 
plenary session.

<p>The major goal of the Conference - to bring together researchers 
from various fields, to advance the state-of-the-art control 
theory and technology for the control and analysis of complex 
oscillatory dynamical systems and to gain some general and unified
 perspectives in this interdisciplinary field of advanced research
 - was achieved.
<p>Another goal of the Conference - to get the world scientific 
community acquainted with recent achievements of Russian experts 
in nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear control - was achieved too.

<p>Financially the Conference was a success (no losses).
The IUTAM grant US$ 1000 for partial reimbursement of travel 
expenses  was distributed to 15 attendees according to the decision
taken at the IPC-NOC meeting during the Conference.
