Physical Fundamentals of Oscillation Theory.
</font>
<hr>
SPb State Polytechnical University, 2005. 258 p. ISBN 5-7422-0850-2.
<hr>

The book is devoted to the analysis of linear, time-variant and nonlinear 
system oscillations within a unified frequency approach framework.

<BR>

Having introduced the fundamental phase and magnitude balance principle, the 
new results in a number of essential phenomena in nonlinear oscillations are 
given. Numerous examples of various application fields compose a separate 
book section.

<BR>

The book is to be useful for experts in oscillation analysis, theorists as 
well as engineers dealing with study and design of oscillating systems. 
Since the presented in the book methods are simple and graphically explicit 
it could be recommended to assist classical "Oscillation Theory" course for 
the wide spectrum of technical specialties.
