St.Petersburg: Nauka, 2004, 272 p.
<hr>

In the book the research results in the field of cybernetical physics --- new area
on the borderland between physics and control aimed at studying physical systems by
cybernetical methods are presented/ The results on oscillations and vibrations dynamics
and control in nonlinear mechanical systems are described. New algorithms for
control of molecular systems, crystalline lattices, phase transitions are presented.
Possibilities of modelling nonequilibrium processes by methods of cybernetical physics
are studied.

The book is intended for students, teachers, engineers or researches interested in physics,
mechanics, systems theory and control theory.
