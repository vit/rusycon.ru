St.Petersburg (the former capital of Russia) with about 5 millions
inhabitants is recognized as one of the most beautiful cities in the
world. Various guided tours over St.Petersburg and suburbs
including visits to Tsars' palaces and museums will be organized during both
 the Conference days and the weekend.
</p>
<p>
    St.Petersburg is known not only for its palaces and museums.
It is a historical scientific center of Russia, where the 1st Russian
University and Russian Academy of Sciences were founded in 1724.
Among first professors of St.Petersburg University were
Leonhard Euler (who lived in St.Petersburg for  30 years and wrote  his
best papers there) and Daniil Bernoulli. Therefore in addition to
sightseeing tours we are planning to organize historical scientific tours
 including visits to historical buildings of St.Petersburg University and
Russian Academy of Sciences. You will have unique possibility  to see
houses where L.Euler,  P.Chebyshev, A.M.Lyapunov, A.A.Markov
lived and worked.
